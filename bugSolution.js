The exact solution is difficult to pin down as the error was intermittent and context dependent.  However, a series of steps usually resolved the problem. Here are some code snippets that helped in the debugging process, though didn't directly solve the `metro-resolver` issue:

//Checking for conflicting dependencies and outdated packages:
//This would involve examining the package.json file for conflicts and using npm-check-updates
npm-check-updates -u
npm install

//Cleaning the cache to remove any corrupted or outdated information.
expo prebuild --clean

//Restarting the expo server
expo start --dev --clear
